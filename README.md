Heart Sound Classification Using a Machine and Deep Learning 


The classification model is developed using a total of 542 PhonoCardioGram(PCG) samples collected by electronic stethoscopes or mobile devices. We use both deep and feature-based approaches for classification. After pre-processing and denoising of PCG signals, N features have been extracted from raw data. Extracted features fed to LightGBM, a gradient boosting based classifier. A deep learning approach is also used by feeding raw signals to a convolutional neural network (CNN). In order to improve accuracy in a noisy environment and robust model, the proposed method uses data augmentation techniques for training data sets.
